          An Immigrant, problem solver by nature. When I was in high school I remember
          a teacher presented to us a blue screen, typed a few lines and the machine
          did all kinds of wonders. I have been into computers since then.

          Later on I moved to the U.S and while working at a bakery I realized if I could
          automate a step in our process we could save ourselves 15 minutes a day and human error.
          I looked into it and after a while managed to write a small script that did what I wanted.
          Then I decided to write software for a living and fun.
